# GraphCAD Demo

This repository provides a demonstration for the GraphCAD project, as described in our ISPD 2025 paper. 
**Note:** This is a minimal demo for learning and reference. The full framework is still under research and not fully open-sourced.

## Repository Structure

- `benchmark/`: Contains test datasets with various cases (e.g., or1200, yacc, SmallBoom, sparc, tv80, oc8051, vga_lcd, arm9, fpu).
- `.pt`: Pretrained model file.
- `.so`: Required shared libraries for testing.
- `test.py`: Testing script.

## Dataset Description

The provided datasets are generated using commercial tools such as PrimeTime and HSPICE.

### Feature File

- `va_map.json`: Mapped features and timing values generated by PrimeTime in Non-SI mode.

### Dataset Folder Structure

- `circuit/`: Circuit-related files.
  - `post-route.v`: Post-routing Verilog netlist.
  - `post-route.spef`: Post-routing SPEF file.
  - `netlist_info.txt`: RC parasitics for each net, extracted from the SPEF file.
  - `.sdc`: SDC constraint files.
- `spice_data/`: Reference ("golden") data.
  - `extracted_data.xlsx`: Compiled extracted data.
  - `spice_data/`: Directory containing `.tr0` waveform files from SPICE simulations.

- Python >= 3.10
- torch >= 1.9
- torch_geometric
- networkx
- tqdm
- scipy
